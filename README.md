05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

Homework 5 by Jordan Triplett
Completed 08/11/2020

This assignment has us create a work day scheduler that stores different tasks to complete at between the hours of 9am-5pm to keep your day organized.

As specified in the assignment, when the planner is opened, the current day is displayed at the top of the page. When scrolling down, one can view timeblocks for standard business hours. When viewing the timeblocks, each block is color coded to indicate if the time is in the past, present, or future. When clicking a timeblock, an event can be entered. When the save button is clicked beside the timeblock, the text for the event is saved in local storage. Since the text is saved in local storage, upon refresh, the saved events do persist. Now go get your day organized!
